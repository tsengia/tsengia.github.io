Block based sandbox games are fantastic. Minecraft and Terraria dominate the market for it, but it's always fun to try to create your own games. Many other open source "voxel" based games and frameworks exist, such as [Voxel JS](https://www.voxeljs.com/) and [MineTest](https://www.minetest.net/).

In my spare time I've also hacked up a little 2D block based sandbox game that I call "2Dimensions." 

In this article, I'll show how to play the game, how it works, and discuss some of its limitations.

## Playing 2Dimensions
You can play 2Dimensions on your web browser by clicking on [this link](assets/static/games/2Dimensions/game.html).

The controls are:
- WASD - Move
- Click - Destroy Blocks

Currently, there are only dirt and grass blocks spanning infinitely in both directions. The logic for falling/jumping is still a bit buggy.

## How it Works
The game screen is an HTML5 Canvas element.
- Rendering Loop
- Physics call

There is also [documentation for 2Dimensions](assets/static/games/2Dimensions/docs/index.html) generated by [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) that gives additional insight into how the game works.

## Limitations
Besides technological debt, the biggest limitation is how the map is stored. Currently, the world map is made up of pure JavaScript Objects. Each block == 1 Object. That's a lot of data for a 50x50 block chunk! 

A better idea would be to use something like an [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) that allows me to manually pack bits and bytes. Additional speedup could be realized by programming in C/C++ and compiling down to WebAssembly. 

As mentioned before, another small bug/quirk is how the logic for detecting falling/collision is written. The bug allows the player to "climb" up walls and sometimes land on "ghost" blocks that don't exist. Honestly, I just haven't taken the time to sit down and think through the math for correcting in the bug, and it doesn't make the game unplayable so for now it stays.
