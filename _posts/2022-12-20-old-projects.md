I grew up programming on a daily basis.  
Every day after school I'm go onto the family computer and start programming.  

I quickly picked up and enjoyed web development with JavaScript and HTML5, especially creating mini games using the HTML5 Canvas element and JavaScript.  
Eventually, I figured out how to use PHP and MySQL to create some websites, which I've preserved on this website too.  

These projects are listed in chrological order: most recent projects at the top and older projects at the bottom.

## 🎹 Piano Web App
During COVID-19 lockdown, I built a small web app to play a virtual piano.  

You can read more and play it [here](archived_work/piano-practice.html).

## 🗺️ Two Dimensions
While learning HTML5 and JavaScript, I created a 2D block based HTML5 Canvas game.  

You can read more about it [here](archived_work/two-dimensions.html).

## ➕ 4 Bit CMOS 4XXX series Full Adder
For my electronics class in high school, I build a 4 Bit fuller adder using only discreet CMOS 4XXX series IC's.  

You can read more about it [here](archived_work/4bit-cmos-adder.html).

## 🔒 Keypad Widget
My father is an Instructional Tech Specialist, which means he helps teachers use technology in the classroom. He once asked me to code up a little web widget for students to use for the popular "breakout room" activity.  

So using HTML and JavaScript I made a webpage that shows a keypad.
If you type in the right combo, it flashes "Success!".
The default key code is `48362`.

## 📚 MLA8 Citation Generator
During highschool, I had a large literature-oriented research project that required making dozens of MLA-8 citations. I didn't like using Chegg's Easybib citation generator because the number of ads on the website made it painfully slow. So, instead I created my own citation generator.

Please note, this generator is bound to have problems, and I am not liable for any issues arising from the use of this generator.  
This generator is licensed under the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).

## 🐟 8 Bit Bio
During middle school, a good friend of mine and I decided to build a website to turn in as our project for Biology Class. We named it 8BitBio and thought we could make "biology cool again."  
Wow, just writing that makes me cringe now.  

Writing the website taught me about PHP, IP addresses and how HTTP servers work.

## 🎬 Proanimation's Weebly Website
My very first website was built on [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/).  
As you can tell, the styling was pretty bad, but I thought it was awesome as a kiddo.  
I used this site to host my HTML5 and JavaScript creations.  

Some of the links on the website are broken and lost to time forever.
