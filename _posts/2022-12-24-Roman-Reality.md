During my highschool years, I participated in a local computer fair and developed a simple VR app called "Roman Reality" that teaches users about the Roman Colloseum. It only won a 3rd place prize due to poor UX, but I gained some great experience programming the app.  

In this article, I will discuss how the Roman Reality app is used, how it works, and the shortcomings of the application.  

You can view [the source code for Roman Reality on GitHub](https://github.com/tsengia/Roman-Reality).
