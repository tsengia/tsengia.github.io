When I'm really in the trenches or automating something, I use `sed`, `cat` and `less`.

## What I'm Learning Now
__Lanuages:__ Rust, TypeScript  

I recently bought myself a copy of [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/1718503105) and currently teaching myself Rust. Coming from a C/C++ background, Rust seems very powerful with its safety features, type checking, and helpful compiler error messages. 

I've also been learning more TypeScript while working on an Ember JS application written in TypeScript.  

__Tools:__ AWS  
I am working towards my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, so I am taking the time to learn more about AWS. The capabilities of AWS are astounding, and it would be foolish of me to not continue to learn as much as possible about it.  

__Skills:__ UI/UX  
I am working on maturing my UI/UX abilities, specifically for web applications.
