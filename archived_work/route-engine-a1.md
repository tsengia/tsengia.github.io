While learning JavaScript and HTML5 for game development, I created my own web-based IDE for rapidly testing and debugging the games I would create.  
I called my IDE the RouteEngineA1 studio.  

The IDE has code highlighting thanks to a JavaScript library called [Code Mirror](https://codemirror.net/).
